Operating:

Your "spaceship" is an ugly rectangle, red on the left, green on the right,
like the lighting colors on an aircraft or boat. You have two thrusters, one
attached on the left side, the other on the right, both of which provide
forward thrust. The left arrow key activates the left thruster, the right arrow
key activates the right thruster.
